# Grade-Book-Database


To compile and execute the provided SQL code, first, make sure you have a compatible SQL database management system (DBMS) installed on your system, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Microsoft SQL Server. Next, create a new database or use an existing one where you have appropriate permissions to create and manipulate tables and data. Copy the SQL code into a text editor and save the file with a ".sql" extension, like "gradebook.sql". Then, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the SQL file. Connect to your SQL database using the command-line tool or graphical interface provided by your DBMS. Execute the SQL script by running a command like [DBMS command] -u [username] -p [password] [database_name] < gradebook.sql, replacing placeholders with your specific details. Once the script executes successfully, verify the creation of tables, insertion of data, and execution of queries by querying your database or using your DBMS interface. Optionally, customize the SQL script to fit your requirements, such as modifying data or adding additional queries. Finally, review and test the SQL code thoroughly before deploying it in a production environment to ensure data integrity and security.
